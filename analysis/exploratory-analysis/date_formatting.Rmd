Checking date format between standard_catch and standard_flow

# QC Checks {.tabset}

## Standard flow

Date is formatted as a date without hms.

```{r}
flow_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data","standard-format-data", "standard_flow.csv")) %>% glimpse
```


## Standard catch

Date is formatted as POSIXct

```{r}
catch_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data","standard-format-data", "standard_catch.csv")) %>% glimpse
```

## Standard trap

Date is formatted as POSIXct
```{r}
trap_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data","standard-format-data", "standard_trap.csv")) %>% glimpse
```
## Standard environmental

Date formatted as date.

```{r}
environment_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data","standard-format-data", "standard_environmental.csv")) %>% glimpse
```
## Standard recapture

Date formatted as POSIXct.

```{r}
recapture_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data","standard-format-data", "standard_recapture.csv")) %>% glimpse
```
## Standard release

Date formatted as POSIXct.

```{r}
release_raw <- read_csv(here::here("data","standard-format-data", "standard_release.csv")) %>% glimpse
```

# Fix

Identified fix is to format standard_catch date as date rather than POSIXct. This
will be done in the rst_catch_standard_format.Rmd. This is the Rmd that generates
the standard format date so best to keep all fixes in one place.

Additionally check standard_trap. Decided to format trap_start_date and trap_stop_date
as date rather than POSIXct. 

Checked standard recapture. Format recaptured_date to date rather than POSIXct.

Checked standard release. Format release_date to date rather than POSIXct.
