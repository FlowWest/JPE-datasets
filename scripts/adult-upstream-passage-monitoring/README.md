# Adult Upstream Passage Monitoring Data

This directory contains markdown documents exploring Adult Upstream Passage monitoring datasets for 7 tributaries. There is no upstream passage data for the Sacramento River. There is no upstream passage video data for the Feather River but there is tagging data that we could use to estimate fish counts, summer 2022 installing video monitoring system. 

Most upstream passage data is video data, battle creek has additional trapping data to inform upstream passage counts.

We currently have passage estimates for Clear Creek (in PDF report),  Battle Creek, and the Yuba River (in PDF report).
